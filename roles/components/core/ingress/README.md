# Ingress

This role deploys Contour and Envoy components for Ingress as well as ExternalDNS for external cluster DNS management.  In vSphere environments, a Metal LB load balancer
to provide Service Type of Load Balancer is also deployed.

## Architecture

RPK's architecture can be found [here](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#service-routing).

## Resource Sizing Requirements

The following sizing requirements must be met for this role to operate properly.  Sizing includes additional [dependencies](#dependencies).

| vCPU | Memory | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4Gi | N/A - no persistent storage required |

**NOTE:** above sizing requirements will adjust based on cluster size due to
components utilizing a DaemonSet.

## Deploying

**NOTE:** roles from `.dependencies.yaml` are also deployed.

In order to deploy the role from a versioned image:

```bash
ROLE=ingress make deploy.role
```

If you've made changes to the role and need to verify your changes:

```bash
ROLE=ingress make deploy.test.role
```

## Demonstrating

Once the role has run successfully, you should be able to demonstrate the role.

In order to demonstrate the role:

**NOTE:** this is a work in progress.  See [Verification](#verification) for steps to manually demonstrate
the role.

```bash
ROLE=ingress make demo.role
```

## Verification

### Contour

Follow steps located at https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/#example-workload for verification of ingress.

### AWS Route53 DNS Backend

See the following links to verify the proper operation of external-dns:

* https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/aws.md#verify-externaldns-works-ingress-example
* https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/aws.md#verify-externaldns-works-service-example

### Azure DNS Backend

See the following links to verify the proper operation of external-dns:

* https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/azure.md#deploying-an-nginx-service
* https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/azure.md#verifying-azure-dns-records

### Internal DNS Backend

```bash
# Observe the running external-dns pod and note the pod name
kubectl get pods -n tanzu-dns

# Check the container logs
## You should observe the addition of records in both sets of logs
kubectl logs [pod name] -c bind -n tanzu-dns
kubectl logs [pod name] -c external-dns -n tanzu-dns

# Obtain the service IP Address/Hostname and note the EXTERNAL-IP
kubectl get service -n tanzu-dns

# Test that you can look up an ingress or service
nslookup registry.[your domain] [EXTERNAL IP]
```

## Cleaning

To remove the role, from the root of the repo:

```bash
ROLE=ingress make clean.role
```
