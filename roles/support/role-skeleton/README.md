# Ansible Galaxy Role Skeleton

An example Ansible Galaxy Role Skeleton to help enforce documentation standards.  This skeleton has a minimalistic directory structure, and the meta directory has been removed.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your development workstation.
2. Initialize your new role with the following command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy role init --role-skeleton=/path/to/cloned/role/skeleton/repository <NEW-ROLE-NAME-HERE>
```
